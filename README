This is the configuration we use to extract changesets and run gitdm on them.

* Tweaking your affiliation

	This mostly happens in domain_map; there should be no need to
touch the 'oracle' and 'go-oo' files, which tag legacy account
affiliation.

* Running analyse_stats

To run this, you will also need a patched gitdm; something like this:

cd ..
git clone git://git.lwn.net/gitdm.git
cd gitdm
for p in ../gitdm-config/gitdm-patches/*; do
	patch -p1 < $p
done

Then - simply run:

./analyse_commits /path/to/libreoffice/core/checkout

	This will lead you through checking out some extra (old) clone
repositories eg. 'build', and to pull the (unusual) notes to have the
legacy tags we need.

	Having got that right - you shoudl end up with a
stats-$year-$week directory containing the required data.

	Best of luck interpreting it.
